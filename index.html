                <h2>Low-productivity Future</h2>
                <p>AI displaces workers, who end up doing menial jobs, blunting any aggregate benefit to the economy’s long-term productivity growth.</p>
<p>Businesses don’t know how to properly implement AI to increase productivity and even modest economic gains take decades to show up in the data.</p>
<p>AI models are trained on data that likely includes the protected intellectual property of others.</p>
<p>This could de-incentivize creatives to produce more innovative content.

                 <h2>High-productivity Future</h2>
                 <p>AI complements workers, allowing them to spend more time on tasks that are creative and novel rather than tedious and rote.</p>
<p>A growing share of society comes to resemble a society of research scientists and innovators.</p>
<p>This results in an economy that’s not only more productive, but also at a permanently higher growth rate.</p>
<p>AI enables society to make advances in medicine, math, science, and further AI development.

                <h2>Higher-inequality Future</h2>
                <p>AI is designed & implemented to replace much human labor, driving down wages for many workers.</p>
<p>The labor market is increasingly divided into a tiny, high-skilled elite and a massive underclass of low-paid service workers.

                 <h2>Lower-inequality Future</h2>
                 <p>AI is designed & implemented to help the least competent workers do their jobs better.</p> <p>It improves the psychological experience of work, as well as the quality of output.</p>
<p>If employers shared productivity gains with workers, distribution of income would become more equal.

                <h2>Higher-concentration Future</h2>
                <p>AI enables the largest corporations to become more productive, profitable, and larger than their competitors.</p>
<p>AI models become more costly to develop, train, and operate because of the massive raw computational power and datasets that are required.</p>
<p>This advantages the firms with the largest budgets and existing datasets, meaning only the largest corporations develop proprietary AI, and become even larger.

                 <h2>Lower-concentration Future</h2>
                 <p>Open-source AI models are widely available, leveling the playing field for small businesses.</p>
<p>In an internal memo leaked from Google in May 2023, a researcher said that “open-source models are faster, more customizable, more private, and pound-for-pound more capable” than proprietary models.</p>
<p>They predicted that open-source AI may end up dominating proprietary models.
