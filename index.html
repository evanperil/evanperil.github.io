                <h2>Low-productivity Future</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>AI displaces workers, who end up doing menial jobs, blunting any aggregate benefit to the economy’s long-term productivity growth.</li>
                  <li>Businesses don’t know how to properly implement AI to increase productivity and even modest economic gains take decades to show up in the data.</li>
                  <li>AI models are trained on data that likely includes the protected intellectual property of others.</li>
                  <li>This could de-incentivize creatives to produce more innovative content.</li>

                 <ul>
                   <li>AI complements workers, allowing them to spend more time on tasks that are creative and novel rather than tedious and rote.</li>
                   <li>A growing share of society comes to resemble a society of research scientists and innovators.</li>
                   <li>This results in an economy that’s not only more productive, but also at a permanently higher growth rate.</li>
                   <li>AI enables society to make advances in medicine, math, science, and further AI development.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>AI is designed & implemented to replace much human labor, driving down wages for many workers.</li>
                  <li>The labor market is increasingly divided into a tiny, high-skilled elite and a massive underclass of low-paid service workers.</li>

                 <ul>
                   <li>AI is designed & implemented to help the least competent workers do their jobs better.</li>
                   <li>It improves the psychological experience of work, as well as the quality of output.</li>
                   <li>If employers shared productivity gains with workers, distribution of income would become more equal.</li>

                <h2>Higher-concentration Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI enables the largest corporations to become more productive, profitable, and larger than their competitors.</li>
<li>AI models become more costly to develop, train, and operate because of the massive raw computational power and datasets that are required.</li>
<li>This advantages the firms with the largest budgets and existing datasets, meaning only the largest corporations develop proprietary AI, and become even larger.</li>

                 <h2>Lower-concentration Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open-source AI models are widely available, leveling the playing field for small businesses.</li>
<li>In an internal memo leaked from Google in May 2023, a researcher said that “open-source models are faster, more customizable, more private, and pound-for-pound more capable” than proprietary models.</li>
<li>They predicted that open-source AI may end up dominating proprietary models.</li>
