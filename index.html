                <h2>Low-productivity Future</h2>
                <p>AI displaces workers, who end up doing menial jobs, blunting any aggregate benefit to the economy’s long-term productivity growth.

Businesses don’t know how to properly implement AI to increase productivity and even modest economic gains take decades to show up in the data.

AI models are trained on data that likely includes the protected intellectual property of others.

This could de-incentivize creatives to produce more innovative content.

                 <h2>High-productivity Future</h2>
                 <p>AI complements workers, allowing them to spend more time on tasks that are creative and novel rather than tedious and rote.
A growing share of society comes to resemble a society of research scientists and innovators.
This results in an economy that’s not only more productive, but also at a permanently higher growth rate.
AI enables society to make advances in medicine, math, science, and further AI development.

                <h2>Higher-inequality Future</h2>
                <p>AI is designed & implemented to replace much human labor, driving down wages for many workers.
The labor market is increasingly divided into a tiny, high-skilled elite and a massive underclass of low-paid service workers.

                 <h2>Lower-inequality Future</h2>
                 <p>AI is designed & implemented to help the least competent workers do their jobs better. It improves the psychological experience of work, as well as the quality of output.
If employers shared productivity gains with workers, distribution of income would become more equal.

                <h2>Higher-concentration Future</h2>
                <p>AI enables the largest corporations to become more productive, profitable, and larger than their competitors.
AI models become more costly to develop, train, and operate because of the massive raw computational power and datasets that are required.
This advantages the firms with the largest budgets and existing datasets, meaning only the largest corporations develop proprietary AI, and become even larger.

                 <h2>Lower-concentration Future</h2>
                 <p>Open-source AI models are widely available, leveling the playing field for small businesses.
In an internal memo leaked from Google in May 2023, a researcher said that “open-source models are faster, more customizable, more private, and pound-for-pound more capable” than proprietary models.
They predicted that open-source AI may end up dominating proprietary models.
