                <h2>Low-productivity Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI displaces workers, who end up doing menial jobs, blunting any aggregate benefit to the economy’s long-term productivity growth.</li>
<li>Businesses don’t know how to properly implement AI to increase productivity and even modest economic gains take decades to show up in the data.</li>
<li>AI models are trained on data that likely includes the protected intellectual property of others. This could de-incentivize creatives to produce more innovative content.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="productivitygrowth-item"> 
                 <h2>High-productivity Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI complements workers, allowing them to spend more time on tasks that are creative and novel rather than tedious and rote.</li>
<li>A growing share of the labor force  comes to resemble a society of research scientists and innovators. This results in an economy that’s not only more productive, but also at a permanently higher growth rate.</li>
<li>AI enables society to make advances in medicine, math, science, and further AI development.</li>

            <div class="incomeinequality-item">
                <h2>Higher-inequality Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI is designed & implemented to replace much human labor, driving down wages for many workers.</li>
<li>Entire industries are upended and replaced (a worry foreshadowed by the recent strikes of actors and screenwriters, whose demands included studios restrict their use of AI).</li>
<li>Workers must settle for low-paying service jobs (such as hospital orderlies, nannies, and doormen) where human presence is still valued, and the pay is so low that it’s not worth it for businesses to replace them.</li>
<li>The labor market is increasingly divided into a tiny, high-skilled elite and a massive underclass of low-paid service workers.</li>
</ul>
            </div>


            <div class="incomeinequality-item">
                 <h2>Lower-inequality Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI is designed & implemented to help the least competent workers do their jobs better.</li>
<li>It improves the psychological experience of work, as well as the quality of output.</li>
<li>A study of 5,000 workers who do complex customer service jobs at a call center found that of workers who received AI assistance, the least skilled or newest employees showed the most productivity gains. The call center also saw reduced employee turnover & increased customer satisfaction for those getting AI assistance (Brynjolfsson, Li, and Raymond 2023).</li>
<li>If employers shared productivity gains with workers, distribution of income would become more equal.</li>

                <h2>Higher-concentration Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI enables the largest corporations to become more productive, profitable, and larger than their competitors.</li>
<li>AI models become more costly to develop, train, and operate because of the massive raw computational power and datasets that are required.</li>
<li>This advantages the firms with the largest budgets and existing datasets, meaning only the largest corporations develop proprietary AI, and become even larger.</li>
<li>AI helps the largest companies improve the efficiency of their complex business operations, neutralizing smalls firms’ local knowledge in a decentralized market.</li>

            <div class="industrialconcentration-item">
                 <h2>Lower-concentration Future</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open-source AI models are widely available, leveling the playing field for small businesses.</li>
<li>In an internal memo leaked from Google in May 2023, a researcher said that “open-source models are faster, more customizable, more private, and pound-for-pound more capable” than proprietary models.</li>
<li>The researcher also said that open-source models are more user-friendly and cheaper to train.</li>
<li>They predicted that open-source AI may end up dominating proprietary models.</li>
